### LOOPS PRACTICE ###

## FOR LOOPS

# 1. Ask the user to input a number. This represents money inputted in the bank.
# Also ask the user for the number of the years they would like to keep their money in the bank.
# Use a for loop to apply an interest rate of 5% to the money that is inputted.


## WHILE LOOPS

# 2.  Ask the user to input an amount of money in cents. 
# Use a while loop to find out the maximum number of quarters, dimes, nickels, & pennies can be made out of it 


## LOOPS WITH VARIABLES

# 3.  Ask the user to input an number. Then create a multiplication table.
# E.g. if the user inputs 3. Print out a 3 x 3 multiplication table. 
# HINT: Use a nested loop!
